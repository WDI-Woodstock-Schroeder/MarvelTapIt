#:small_blue_diamond: Welcome to the Marvel Universe! :small_blue_diamond:

Marvel TapIt is an interactive, two player melee where each player taps a key to attack
their opponent to elimination.  On a keyboard, player 1 presses the 'A' key to attack player 2, while player 2 presses the 'L' key to attack player 1.  On mobile/tablet devices, the players simply tap the picture of their opponent to intitiate attacking.

This application was developed using Ruby on Rails and Javascript to create the animated environment.  The development team implemented this application to consume images and data from the Marvel API via AJAX calls to render character information.

The development team came across challenges when deciding on the use of different technologies and the implementation of nested functions. The team was ultimately drawn to the logical flow of using Javascript to create site interactions. The result is a simple yet entertaining responsive fighting game.

Thanks for playing!
